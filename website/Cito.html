      <h2>&#8544; . Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This report investigates the potential correlation between research
        productivity and grant allocation by analyzing citation and publication
        data in relation to the NSERC Discovery Grant (DG). The Discovery Grant,
        offered by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
        Canada, supports Canadian university researchers in advancing knowledge
        across science and engineering disciplines. One of the key potential 
        indicators to assess a researcher's impact is the number of recent publications
        and the impact they have, in other words, the amount of citations. To explore this 
        relationship, we collected data on Canadian computer scientists who received a DG over the past 15 years,
        then compiled their publication and citation counts from Google Scholar,
        focusing on the years in which each researcher won the discovery grant. This study aims to
        determine whether a measurable link exists between research impact and
        funding decisions through statistical analysis and data visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper is organized as follows: in Section &#8544;&#8544; we go over briefly of our technique to gather the researchers who won 
        the discovery grant award in computer science. We then continue on how we used the names and Google Scholar to obtain each researcher's
        publication count and citation count on the years they won the award. Section &#8544;&#8544;&#8544; goes over data analysis, what we tested, our
        results on the tests. Section &#8547; we will go over the results we got and what they could possibly mean in terms of NSERC's merit criteria for the award.

      <h2>&#8544;&#8544;. Data Gathering</h2>
      <p>
        To begin, we first collected a list of the winners of the discovery grant from the last 15 years. 
        We achieved this by using NSERC's award database and obtaining the excel sheet for everyone who has won an award in the computer science field.
        This was done manually and the result was an excel file with the name, award, and year of computer science award winners. We then created getNames.py script which
        goes through the excel sheet using pandas, to grab the names and years of those who won the discovery grant. We then needed to obtain the publication and citation counts 
        for each winner during the year that they won. The way we did this is through the web scraping library Scholarly. getCounts.py uses the scholarly 
        api to search for each researchers Google Scholar page returning a json of all the data on the author page. We then searched through the json for all publications 
        that were published during the year that that author won and the number of citations for all those publications. Those researchers without a google scholar page were ignored and are not 
        featured in our data. The following table is the table of researchers who won the discovery grant with their name, year they won, publication count and citation count.

      <h2>&#8544;&#8544;&#8544;. Data Analysis</h2>
      <p> We began by analyzing the publication count for each researcher. We plotted a publication count vs researcher bar graph
        as seen in Fig. 1. From this graph we see that the average publication count is about 8.77 publications in a year. This number is
        quite high as research papers take a long time to complete due to the collecting of data, producing results, and then analyzing them.
        The lowest publication count is held by multiple researchers at just one. It's likely that their research paper held a huge impact
        in their field and helped them achieve the award despite the low publication count. The largest number of publications done in the year where the researcher 
        won was by Nicholas Harvey with 71 publications in a year. The number of publications themselves do not seem to be a criteria for the 
        award but rather the quality publications and their potential impact on the future.

      <p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 1. Relationship between publication count and the researcher</p>
      <p>
        We then took a similar approach to look at each researcher's citation counts during the year that they won the award. Using the data from Table &#8544;
        we plotted a citation vs researcher bar graph as seen in Fig. 2. The bar graph shows that the average citation number was about 574. This number is quite high
        indicating that NSERC values more the impact of a publication quite highly. The lowest publication count in our data is 0 by several researchers. This could 
        be due to the researchers not updating their google scholar author page and thus not having all the data present. Another potential explanation is that NSERC's other criteria
        was enough for these researchers to win the award without having a publication with a lot of impact in their field. The highest citation count was by Jonathan Anderson where
        just only 27 publications resulted in 13892 citations in 2015 when he won the award.

      <p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2. Relationship between citation count and the researcher</p>
      <p>
        Finally, we looked at the publication count vs citation count to see if there is any correlation between the two. Using the data from the Table &#8544; we plotted a 
        scatter plot of publication counts vs citation counts as seen in Fig. 3. From this plot we calculated the r value using the matplotlib function. The r value is a value between 
        -1 and 1 and indicates the level of correlation between the two variables. An r value of 1 represents a strong positive correlation between the two variables while a r value of -1 indicates
        a strong negative correlation between them and an r value close to 0 indicates no correlation. The r value we observed was r = 0.59, this value is relatively high and indicates
        a moderate positive correlation. What this means in context of the criteria is that the researchers who won the award won it due to the quality of their research over the quantity. Most of the work published was of high quality and thus is impactful and got a high citation count while those
        with just high publication counts were unlikely to win the award if their publications had no impact.

      <h2>&#8547;. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The analysis conducted in this project reveals a moderate positive
        correlation between researchers’ publication and citation counts and
        their eligibility for the NSERC Discovery Grant, as reflected by a
        Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.59. While this suggests that higher
        research output and academic influence may enhance a researcher’s
        chances of receiving funding, it also highlights that the impact of a publication is 
        an important factor in terms of NSERC criteria. This is further shown in the average citation count 
        of the researcher being 500+ which indicates that NSERC values impactful publications. However, other
        qualitative factors likely play a role in funding decisions, such as the
        research proposal’s innovation, importance to the field, and alignment with NSERC’s
        priorities.
